Disclaimers,"Tindak Malaysia calculates all the percentages for electoral demographics. There is no official ethnic demographic data. The percentages for electoral demographics may not attain exactly 100%, but the variation is kept below 2%. Malay Electors are clumped together under the Muslim Bumiputera community. Bumiputera Sarawak community would have been classified as Others, Non-Muslim Bumiputera, and Muslim Bumiputera category. Orang Kurang Upaya (OKU) or People with Disabilities (PWD) count is estimated. Age groups are based on the age of the voters as of 31/12/2020.
